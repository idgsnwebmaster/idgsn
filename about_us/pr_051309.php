IDG Communications U.K. joined the IDG TechNetwork last summer.  Since its launch one year ago, the network has grown to more than 150 non-IDG Web sites with more than 40 million unique visitors per month.</p>					<p>&quot;This expansion provides technology marketers with access to an unparalleled audience of IT professionals and tech enthusiasts in several countries,&quot; said Peter Longo, CEO, IDG Syndication and Networks.  &quot;With 30 channels to choose from advertisers can be very selective among enterprise, tech enthusiasts, and gaming and entertainment audiences.&quot;  The IDG TechNetwork complements the reach of IDG media brands in more than 90 countries.</p>					<p>The success of the U.S. and U.K. TechNetworks and the increasing popularity of ad networks led to this international expansion.  Chris Byers, founder of <a href="http://www.edugeek.net/" target="_blank">Edugeek.net</a> , one of IDG TechNetwork&amp;s first publisher members in the U.K. said, &quot;Working with IDG has worked out very well.  We feature relevant campaigns at good rates and are able to harness IDG&amp;s global reach and international sales forces to monetize our overseas traffic most effectively.&quot; </p> 					<p>IDG TechNetwork U.S. will lead the international expansion in conjunction with IDG subsidiaries that will handle ad sales and recruitment of publishers.   Marketing programs include contextual and behavioral targeting, roadblocks and sponsorships, video ads, newsletter sponsorship, and lead generation. </p>					<h4>Research Shows Ad Networks a Major Part of Tech Advertising Plans</h4>					<p>In an online survey of 136 marketers and agencies in the U.S., 79 percent reported that they used ad networks last year and 85 percent plan to advertise in them this year.
