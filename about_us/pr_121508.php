					<h3>IDG TechNetwork Grows Rapidly in Revenue, Unique Visitors, and Pageviews; GigaOm Network Joins the IDG Media Network</h3>
					<p><strong>FRAMINGHAM, MA &ndash; December 15, 2008</strong> &ndash; Just nine months after its debut, the IDG TechNetwork has passed more than 120 million pageviews per month, 40 million monthly unique visitors, and its monthly revenue has grown almost eightfold. The media and ad network of non-IDG publishers has grown to almost 200 serving tech enterprise, enthusiast, and gamer/entertainment audiences since last March.</p>
					<p>Among the latest media companies to join the IDG TechNetwork (www.idgtechnetwork.com) is The GigaOm Network, an online company with technology and business Web sites. GigaOm is the acclaimed tech site, founded by Om Malik and featuring news, analysis, and opinions on topics ranging from Web 2.0 and online games to broadband. In selecting IDG as its advertising representative for seven sites, Paul Walborsky, CEO, GigaOm Network, said: &quot;We chose a media company that is the global leader for technology news and information.&quot; Peter Longo, CEO, IDG Syndication and Networks welcomed the addition of GigaOm Network and said, &quot;It represents an important step in the significant expansion of the IDG TechNetwork. GigaOm Network is a marquee name in the tech world.&quot;</p>
					<p>The IDG TechNetwork features enterprise IT sites focused on storage, management, networking, open source, cloud computing, mobile, and green IT. On the consumer enthusiast side are sites for users of PCs, Apple products, and tech gadgets. Amit Agarwal, founder, Digital Inspiration, said: &quot;Partnering with IDG Tech Network has helped us improve advertising revenues significantly while we continue to remain focused on expanding our content offerings.&quot; For gamers and entertainment, there are publishers covering online and PC games as well as reviews.</p>
					<p>Other media members of the IDG TechNetwork include HowtoForge, Circle ID, and Linux Open Source blog. A range of technology advertisers have signed on to the network including Dell, Novell, AT&amp;T, Vette Corporation, Intel, Avaya, and Citrix.</p>
					<p>&quot;The IDG TechNetwork provides vertical focus with a trusted media reputation, market knowledge, and long-standing relationships with marketers and ad agencies,&quot; explained Longo. &quot;Adding this network of outside publishers to existing IDG media brands is a powerful option for marketers looking to target their defined segments of tech audiences.&quot;</p>
